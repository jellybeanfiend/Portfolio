  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Sevena! I am currently a senior at the University of Central Florida pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I created this website to tell the world a little bit about myself and show what I have accomplished so far in my career as a computer science student and a web developer!</p>

  <p>When I am not working on web applications or school projects, I like to adventure around Skyrim, sew clothes and costumes, or go rock climbing at the UCF gym.</p>
